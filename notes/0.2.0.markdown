### Changes

* Deprecate `refine` and `refineLit` in favor of the new `refineT` and
  `refineMT` (where `T` stands for tag/`@@` and `M` for macro). In addition,
  there are two other variants of these functions, `refineV` and `refineMV`,
  that use the newly added `Refined` value class instead of `@@`. The advantages
  of `Refined` is that it can be used in combination with
  [type aliases][type_aliases].
* Add string utility functions to create statically checked regular expressions,
  URIs, URLs, and UUIDs. A detailed description of these functions can be found
  [here][utils]. ([#35], [#38])
* Lift the restriction to refine only literal values at compile-time if a
  `Predicate` is constant (i.e. it ignores its argument when calling `isValid`).
  Some examples of constant predicates are `True` or `False` or the newly added
  `ConstructorNames` and `FieldNames` predicates. Some examples of the last two
  predicates can be found [here][ctorfieldnames]. ([#26])
* Enable tests in the Scala.js build. ([#29])
* Remove `refine` from `Predicate` since the purpose of `Predicate` is
  to check whether a value conforms to a type-level predicate. Refining
  the type of such value is a different concern. ([#31])
* Add inference rules for numeric singleton types to `shapeless.Nat`.

### New predicates

[`generic`](https://github.com/fthomas/refined/blob/v0.2.0/shared/src/main/scala/eu/timepit/refined/generic.scala)

* `ConstructorNames[P]`: checks if the constructor names of a sum type satisfy `P`
* `FieldNames[P]`: checks if the field names of a product type satisfy `P`

[`string`](https://github.com/fthomas/refined/blob/v0.2.0/shared/src/main/scala/eu/timepit/refined/string.scala)

* `Uuid`: checks if a `String` is a valid UUID
