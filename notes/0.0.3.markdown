### Changes

* Reverted the syntax change of `refine` and `refineLit` from 0.0.2. The trick for
  currying type parameters did not work well with type inference and it required
  to always specify the predicate type.

### Bug fixes

* Worked around a strange initialization bug in `refineLit`. ([#3])
