### Changes

* Add `Arbitrary` instances for numeric predicates indexed by `Nat`s and
  improve the implementation of the other numeric `Arbitrary` instances.
  Thanks to Jean-RÃ©mi Desjardins! ([#106], [#109])
* Add the `RefType.refineMF` macro which requires that the base type must
  be specified and cannot be inferred from its argument. This allows to
  define aliases for the `RefineM` macro where the base type and
  predicate are fixed. ([#107])
* Update `refined-scalaz` to Scalaz 7.2.0
